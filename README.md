# Google-maps-latlong-finder.ipynb

This project provides a Jupyter Notebook to find latitude and longitude for locations, useful for tracking orders in e-commerce.

## Project Description

### Overview
This project provides a Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) containing a code snippet that can be used to find the latitude and longitude of a given village or the current location. This functionality is particularly useful for e-commerce websites to track orders and identify the location of products and customers.

### Features
- **Latitude and Longitude Retrieval**: Fetches the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for any specified village or the current location.
- **E-commerce Integration**: Enhances order tracking capabilities by pinpointing the exact location of products and customers, improving logistics and delivery accuracy.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Enables real-time location tracking, ensuring up-to-date information on the whereabouts of orders and deliveries.

### Usage
1. **Download the Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open the `.ipynb` file provided in the repository.
3. **Run the Code Snippet**: Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the code snippet. You can input the name of a village or use the code to find the current location.
4. **Integrate with E-commerce Platform**: Use the latitude and longitude data to enhance the order tracking system on your e-commerce website.

### Benefits
- **Improved Order Tracking**: Provides precise location data, leading to better tracking of orders and improved customer satisfaction.
- **Enhanced Logistics Management**: Helps in optimizing delivery routes and reducing delivery times by knowing the exact location of products.
- **User-friendly**: The Jupyter Notebook format makes it easy to understand and modify the code as per specific requirements.

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open and run the `.ipynb` file.
- **Required Libraries**: The notebook might use libraries such as `geopy` or `requests`. Install any required libraries using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install geopy requests
  ```

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Run the Notebook**: Follow the cells in the notebook to execute the code snippet.

### Code for Usage:

```python
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
import socket
import webbrowser

def locate_ip_address():
    hostname = socket.gethostname()
    ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
    
    try:
        geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="location_finder")
        location = geolocator.geocode(ip_address)
        
        if location:
            print(f"IP Address: {ip_address}")
            print(f"Location: {location.address}")
        else:
            print(f"Could not locate IP address: {ip_address}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

def get_location_coordinates(location):
    geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="location_finder")
    location_data = geolocator.geocode(location)
    
    if location_data:
        print(f"Location: {location_data.address}")
        print(f"Latitude: {location_data.latitude}")
        print(f"Longitude: {location_data.longitude}")
        return location_data.latitude, location_data.longitude
    else:
        print("Location not found.")
        return None, None

def open_google_maps(latitude, longitude):
    url = f"https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query={latitude},{longitude}"
    webbrowser.open(url)

# Example usage
location = "Mumbai"
latitude, longitude = get_location_coordinates(location)

if latitude is not None and longitude is not None:
    open_google_maps(latitude, longitude)
```

**Output**:
```
Location: Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
Latitude: 19.0760
Longitude: 72.8777
```
